### Security updates

- Add ability to login via OIDC provider Operators can now configure a single OIDC authentication provider using a collection of cluster settings that can provide authentication for users into the Admin UI only (not for SQL!). The user must exist as a SQL user in the DB for the authentication to work. [#54659][#54659]

### General changes

- Reduced the memory overhead of rangefeeds which reduces the memory overhead for running CHANGEFEEDs over large tables. [#54631][#54631]

### SQL language changes

- This is a change from earlier 20.2 beta releases. After renaming a database, schema, or type, the old names are immediately inaccessible from other sessions when referred to in schema change statements as soon as the new name is committed. This matches the existing behavior for tables. [#54384][#54384]
- Implement the geometry builtins `ST_Boundary`, `ST_Difference`, and `ST_Relate` (BNR variant). [#54436][#54436]
- Implement the geometry builtins `ST_MinimumClearance` and `ST_MinimumClearanceLine`. [#54436][#54436]
- Implement the geometry builtin `ST_Polygon`. [#54436][#54436]
- Implement the geometry builtin `ST_Angle` [#54436][#54436]
- Implement the geometry builtins `ST_FrechetDistance` and `ST_HausdorffDistance`. [#54436][#54436]
- Implement ST_S2Covering, which returns the S2 coverings used for indexing for geometry and geography types. [#54433][#54433]
- Implement ST_S2Covering with optional index parameters. [#54433][#54433]
- Added the ability to parse the ONLY and * (descendant) clauses in UPDATE. This is a no-op as we do not support [#54426][#54426]
- Added the ability to parse the `CONNECTION LIMIT [=] iconst32` syntax for `CREATE DATABASE`. This is currently a no-op for -1 (default, unlimited connections), and errors for any other value. [#54421][#54421]
- Creating cross-database foreign key references is now disallowed (and can be re-enabled via a cluster setting). [#54520][#54520]
- Creating views that refer to tables in other databases is now disallowed (and can be re-enabled via a cluster setting). [#54520][#54520]
- Partial index definitions in pg_catalog are now formatted with parentheses around the WHERE clause. [#54535][#54535]
- Interleaved joins are now disabled by default and will be entirely removed in 21.1 release because they are often slower than the merge join. [#54162][#54162]
- Foreign key violation errors now fill in the "constraint name" error message field. [#54576][#54576]
- CREATE SCHEDULE output now has a column called `label` which was previously called `name`. [#54397][#54397]
- If a user/role has ownership over a type or a schema, it is no longer possible to drop them. [#54511][#54511]
- Implement `SHOW GRANTS ON SCHEMA <schema_list>` [#54596][#54596]
- Add a custom information_schema.type_privileges table that displays type privileges for each supported type. [#54596][#54596]
- Implement the `SHOW GRANTS ON TYPE` command, which shows grants for a specific type. [#54596][#54596]
- The `SHOW GRANTS` without any table/type/schema/database qualifier now also shows types. The `table_name` column is renamed to `type_name`. [#54596][#54596]
- Add support for the CREATE EXTENSION syntax. This no-ops for PostGIS, and gives unimplemented errors for extensions we do not yet support but may plan to. [#54595][#54595]
- Add unimplemented errors for using operator classes as parameters for creating an index. [#54595][#54595]
- Creating sequences that are OWNED BY columns in tables in other databases is now disallowed (and can be re-enabled via a cluster setting). [#54585][#54585]

### Command-line changes

- The timing details for query execution in the SQL shell (`cockroach sql`, `cockroach demo`) has been completed to also properly take query parsing and planning time into account. As previously, this timing display can be disabled with `\set show_times off`. [#54623][#54623]
- The format used to display query execution times has been simplified. [#54623][#54623]

### Admin UI changes

- Add ability to login via OIDC provider [#54659][#54659]

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug introduced in earlier v20.2 versions where when attempting to drop a column which is referenced by multiple indexes fails to drop all relevant indexes. [#54262][#54262]
- A bug causing servers to crash with the message "committed txn with writeTooOld" has been fixed. Versions below 20.1.4 were susceptible to this bug; versions 20.1.4+ were no longer crashing, just printing scary messages in the log files. [#54280][#54280]
- Fixed a bug which would cause an internal error when writing to a table with a recently (concurrent or in the same transaction) NOT NULL enum column. [#54432][#54432]
- Cockroach now properly returns an appropriate error when the user attempts to rename a constraint to a name which conflicts with an existing index. [#54430][#54430]
- Fixed bug from earlier alphas where dropping a database which contained tables using user-defined types could result in panics. [#54431][#54431]
- Fixed an internal error and/or panic that could occur when the ST_Distance or ST_MaxDistance functions were compared against a constant or variable with any type other than float. For example, previously, a query with the predicate `WHERE ST_Distance(g1, g2) < 10::int` could cause an error. [#54395][#54395]
- There was a bug in transaction statistics collection that could let the datastructure grow unboundedly large. This is now fixed, and the resetting happens at the same cadence as statement statistics. [#54457][#54457]
- Fixed an internal error in some cases when recursive CTEs are used. [#54419][#54419]
- Previously, when using CopyIn with an extremely large message, the TCP connection would close with no discernable error. This is changed to now display that the message is too big. [#54187][#54187]
- Starting from v20.2.0-alpha.3 CockroachDB would crash when performing an UPSERT with RETURNING clause of more than 10k rows, and this is now fixed. [#54490][#54490]
- Queries that can be automatically retried did not respect the `statement_timeout` earlier, which is now fixed. [#54370][#54370]
- A failure while restoring data, may have sometimes resulted in the restore job becoming stuck. This bug was only present on 20.2 alphas and betas. [#54447][#54447]
- CockroachDB could previously crash in very rare circumstances when there many queries running in the cluster that are consuming a lot of memory and at least one query runs through the vectorized execution engine. This is now fixed. [#54404][#54404]
- In a previous beta, backing up to an auto-appendable directory would not work if authentication parameters were specified in the URI. [#54621][#54621]
- Fixed bug from earlier alphas whereby jobs would not properly populate their `started` timestamp. [#54638][#54638]

### Performance improvements

- Left outer spatial joins can now be index-accelerated, which can lead to performance improvements in some cases. [#54110][#54110]
- The optimizer can now use partial indexes for lookup join operations. This results in potentially more efficient query plans for joins on tables with partial indexes. [#54362][#54362]
- Lookup semi- and anti-joins are now explored by the optimizer in more cases when the ON filter implies a partial index predicate. This may lead to more efficient query plans in some cases. [#54362][#54362]
- Spatial anti joins can now be index-accelerated, which can lead to performance improvements in some cases. [#54471][#54471]

### Miscellaneous

#### Missing category

- The first timing column in the trace.txt file collected as part of a statement diagnostics bundle is no longer bogus. [#54559][#54559]
